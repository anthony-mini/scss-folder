# scss-folder
Shell script that creates a standard scss folder for front-end development.

You can use this either downloading it to your project's web folder and running `sh create-structure.sh`,
or by `cd`ing into the web folder and running:

`curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/whiteoctober/scss-folder/master/create-structure.sh | sh`.

This should be run with `sh` not `bash`, otherwise line breaks in the outputted files go missing.

This repository also contains a copy of everything that the shell script creates, for reference.
